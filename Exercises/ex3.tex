\hspace{2cm}

Consider the damped Burgers equation
$$q_t + \left(\frac{1}{2}q^2\right)_x = - q.$$
Does this equation admit shocks?  Determine necessary
and sufficient conditions (depending on the initial data $q(x,0)$) for shock
formation to occur.

Hint: solve the problem by characteristics and determine whether they will cross.
