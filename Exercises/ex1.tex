{\large Exercise 1} \\
Characteristics for nonlinear scalar conservation laws
\par\end{center}{\large \par}

In class we saw that, for the advection equation
\begin{align}
q_t + a q_x & = 0
\end{align}
the solution is constant along straight lines ({\em characteristics})
in the $x-t$ plane with slope $a$.

Now consider the nonlinear equation
\begin{align} \label{conslaw}
q_t + f(q)_x & = 0.
\end{align}
Show that the solution of \eqref{conslaw} is also constant along straight
lines (i.e., characteristics) and determine their slope.  Explain how
to find the solution of \eqref{conslaw} at a given point $(x^*,t^*)$
using these characteristics (i.e., write down the equation that must be solved
to find $q(x^*,t^*)$).

Hint: consider a straight line $X(t)$ and the total derivative $dq/dt$ along this line.
